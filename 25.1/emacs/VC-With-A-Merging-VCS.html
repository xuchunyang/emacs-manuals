<a name="Basic-Version-Control-with-Merging"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">28.1.3.1 Basic Version Control with Merging</h4>

<p>On a merging-based version control system (i.e., most modern ones;
see <a href="VCS-Merging.html#VCS-Merging">VCS Merging</a>), <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> does the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If there is more than one file in the VC fileset and the files have
inconsistent version control statuses, signal an error.  (Note,
however, that a fileset is allowed to include both newly-added
files and modified files; see <a href="Registering.html#Registering">Registering</a>.)

</li><li> If none of the files in the VC fileset are registered with a version
control system, register the VC fileset, i.e., place it under version
control.  See <a href="Registering.html#Registering">Registering</a>.  If Emacs cannot find a system to
register under, it prompts for a repository type, creates a new
repository, and registers the VC fileset with it.

</li><li> If every work file in the VC fileset is unchanged, do nothing.

</li><li> If every work file in the VC fileset has been modified, commit the
changes.  To do this, Emacs pops up a <samp>*vc-log*</samp> buffer; type the
desired log entry for the new revision, followed by <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to
commit.  See <a href="Log-Buffer.html#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>.

<p>If committing to a shared repository, the commit may fail if the
repository that has been changed since your last update.  In that
case, you must perform an update before trying again.  On a
decentralized version control system, use <kbd>C-x v +</kbd>
(see <a href="Pulling-_002f-Pushing.html#Pulling-_002f-Pushing">Pulling / Pushing</a>) or <kbd>C-x v m</kbd> (see <a href="Merging.html#Merging">Merging</a>).
On a centralized version control system, type <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> again to
merge in the repository changes.
</p>
</li><li> Finally, if you are using a centralized version control system, check
if each work file in the VC fileset is up-to-date.  If any file has
been changed in the repository, offer to update it.
</li></ul>

<p>These rules also apply when you use RCS in its non-locking mode,
except that changes are not automatically merged from the repository.
Nothing informs you if another user has committed changes in the same
file since you began editing it; when you commit your revision, his
changes are removed (however, they remain in the repository and are
thus not irrevocably lost).  Therefore, you must verify that the
current revision is unchanged before committing your changes.  In
addition, locking is possible with RCS even in this mode: <kbd>C-x v
v</kbd> with an unmodified file locks the file, just as it does with RCS in
its normal locking mode (see <a href="VC-With-A-Locking-VCS.html#VC-With-A-Locking-VCS">VC With A Locking VCS</a>).
