<h4 class="subsection">51.1.7 Custom Themes</h4>
<a name="index-custom-themes"></a>

<p><em>Custom themes</em> are collections of settings that can be enabled
or disabled as a unit.  You can use Custom themes to switch easily
between various collections of settings, and to transfer such
collections from one computer to another.
</p>
<p>A Custom theme is stored as an Emacs Lisp source file.  If the name of
the Custom theme is <var>name</var>, the theme file is named
<samp><var>name</var>-theme.el</samp>.  See <a href="Creating-Custom-Themes.html#Creating-Custom-Themes">Creating Custom Themes</a>, for the
format of a theme file and how to make one.
</p>
<a name="index-customize_002dthemes"></a>
<a name="index-custom_002dtheme_002ddirectory"></a>
<a name="index-color-scheme"></a>
<p>Type <kbd>M-x customize-themes</kbd> to switch to a buffer named
<samp>*Custom Themes*</samp>, which lists the Custom themes that Emacs knows
about.  By default, Emacs looks for theme files in two locations: the
directory specified by the variable <code>custom-theme-directory</code>
(which defaults to <samp>~/.emacs.d/</samp>), and a directory named
<samp>etc/themes</samp> in your Emacs installation (see the variable
<code>data-directory</code>).  The latter contains several Custom themes
which are distributed with Emacs, which customize Emacs&rsquo;s faces to fit
various color schemes.  (Note, however, that Custom themes need not be
restricted to this purpose; they can be used to customize variables
too.)
</p>
<a name="index-custom_002dtheme_002dload_002dpath"></a>
<p>If you want Emacs to look for Custom themes in some other directory,
add the directory name to the list variable
<code>custom-theme-load-path</code>.  Its default value is
<code>(custom-theme-directory t)</code>; here, the symbol
<code>custom-theme-directory</code> has the special meaning of the value of
the variable <code>custom-theme-directory</code>, while <code>t</code> stands for
the built-in theme directory <samp>etc/themes</samp>.  The themes listed in
the <samp>*Custom Themes*</samp> buffer are those found in the directories
specified by <code>custom-theme-load-path</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-C_002dx-C_002ds-_0028Custom-Themes-buffer_0029"></a>
<p>In the <samp>*Custom Themes*</samp> buffer, you can activate the checkbox
next to a Custom theme to enable or disable the theme for the current
Emacs session.  When a Custom theme is enabled, all of its settings
(variables and faces) take effect in the Emacs session.  To apply the
choice of theme(s) to future Emacs sessions, type <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>
(<code>custom-theme-save</code>) or use the &lsquo;<samp>[Save Theme Settings]</samp>&rsquo;
button.
</p>
<a name="index-custom_002dsafe_002dthemes"></a>
<p>When you first enable a Custom theme, Emacs displays the contents of
the theme file and asks if you really want to load it.  Because
loading a Custom theme can execute arbitrary Lisp code, you should
only say yes if you know that the theme is safe; in that case, Emacs
offers to remember in the future that the theme is safe (this is done
by saving the theme file&rsquo;s SHA-256 hash to the variable
<code>custom-safe-themes</code>; if you want to treat all themes as safe,
change its value to <code>t</code>).  Themes that come with Emacs (in the
<samp>etc/themes</samp> directory) are exempt from this check, and are
always considered safe.
</p>
<a name="index-custom_002denabled_002dthemes"></a>
<p>Setting or saving Custom themes actually works by customizing the
variable <code>custom-enabled-themes</code>.  The value of this variable is
a list of Custom theme names (as Lisp symbols, e.g., <code>tango</code>).
Instead of using the <samp>*Custom Themes*</samp> buffer to set
<code>custom-enabled-themes</code>, you can customize the variable using the
usual customization interface, e.g., with <kbd>M-x customize-option</kbd>.
Note that Custom themes are not allowed to set
<code>custom-enabled-themes</code> themselves.
</p>
<p>Any customizations that you make through the customization buffer
take precedence over theme settings.  This lets you easily override
individual theme settings that you disagree with.  If settings from
two different themes overlap, the theme occurring earlier in
<code>custom-enabled-themes</code> takes precedence.  In the customization
buffer, if a setting has been changed from its default by a Custom
theme, its &lsquo;<samp>State</samp>&rsquo; display shows &lsquo;<samp>THEMED</samp>&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;<samp>STANDARD</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<a name="index-load_002dtheme"></a>
<a name="index-enable_002dtheme"></a>
<a name="index-disable_002dtheme"></a>
<p>You can enable a specific Custom theme in the current Emacs session
by typing <kbd>M-x load-theme</kbd>.  This prompts for a theme name, loads
the theme from the theme file, and enables it.  If a theme file
has been loaded before, you can enable the theme without loading its
file by typing <kbd>M-x enable-theme</kbd>.  To disable a Custom theme,
type <kbd>M-x disable-theme</kbd>.
</p>
<a name="index-describe_002dtheme"></a>
<p>To see a description of a Custom theme, type <kbd>?</kbd> on its line in
the <samp>*Custom Themes*</samp> buffer; or type <kbd>M-x describe-theme</kbd>
anywhere in Emacs and enter the theme name.
